# Security Policy

At ByteSynergyLabs, we take security seriously and are committed to ensuring the safety and security of our projects and the information of our users. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your reports promptly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of our projects, we encourage you to report it to us in a responsible manner. Please follow these steps to report a vulnerability:

1. **Contact Us**: Send an email to our security team at [security@bytesynergylabs.com](mailto:security@bytesynergylabs.com). Please include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

2. **Provide Details**: In your email, provide detailed information about the vulnerability. Include the following:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - The steps required to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots that illustrate the issue.

3. **Wait for Acknowledgement**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours. Our security team will then investigate the issue and work to resolve it as quickly as possible.

4. **Coordinate Disclosure**: We request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it. We will work with you to coordinate an appropriate disclosure timeline.

## Security Patch Process

Once a vulnerability report is received, we will take the following steps to address the issue:

1. **Initial Triage**: Our security team will perform an initial assessment to determine the severity and impact of the vulnerability.

2. **Issue Reproduction**: We will attempt to reproduce the reported vulnerability to confirm its existence and understand its scope.

3. **Fix Development**: Our development team will work on creating a fix for the vulnerability. Depending on the complexity of the issue, this may involve multiple iterations and testing phases.

4. **Testing and Validation**: The fix will undergo thorough testing and validation to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing new problems.

5. **Release**: Once the fix is validated, we will release a patch as part of a regular update or a dedicated security release.

6. **Communication**: We will communicate the details of the vulnerability and the fix to our users through release notes and other appropriate channels. We will credit the individual who reported the vulnerability unless they prefer to remain anonymous.
